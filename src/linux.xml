   <!-- General considerations 
         All time values can be specified with their unit following.
         Allowed units are: h, m, s, ms. 
         Omiting the units will be interpreted as seconds. 

         Sizes use b for bit, B for byte,
         k for 1024 bytes, m for 1024*1024 bytes, g for 1024*1024*1024 bytes.
         k, m and g are case insensitive.

         Speeds are a size plus "/s", which is the only unit allowed.
         A special speed is "unlimited" which can be used in bandwidths.

         Times, sizes and speeds can contain decimal part (dot is separator).
         Rounding is made towards bytes for sizes/speeds.

         Paths must be specified with forward slashes "/" in windows and unix.
         
         All elements/attributes names are case sensitive!

      <!-- Uploads will be queued in every matching queue that many times.
            There is no problem if a request matches two queues' criteria. 
            RATIONALE: since you can't know in which queue you'll arrive to
            head sooner, Adagio takes the safest approach: clients are queued in
            every queue as many times as total uploads they are allowed. That
            means that if there are 3 queues and 2 uploads per client, one can
            be queued in 6 slots. However, each time a client reaches a head,
            their active uploads are checked. If a client is uploading the 
            maximum allowed, their queued slots will be dropped. That ensures
            respecting the maximum uploads per client and at the same time 
            prevents that clients don't get a file which belongs to a queue 
            because they're queued in another, slower, one. 
            Similarly, when a request reaches a head, it is removed from any
            other queue. -->
