All original source code for Adagio is under the /src folder. Accompaning
libraries are available in internet but have been modified to correct
bugs, remove unused items, provide specific functions needed by Adagio and
not present in the original sources and automatizing the building process. 
Documentation, tutorials, tests, etc. have been stripped but naturally not 
their license agreement. Changes are signaled by comments.

NOTE THAT IF YOU WANT TO USE ANY OF THESE LIBRARIES,YOU SHOULD OBTAIN
THEM IN THEIR MOST RECENT AND COMPLETE VERSION FROM THEIR ORIGINAL
AUTHORS. They are provided with the Adagio source code only to ease
the compilation process and by no other reason.
